UNCOMPRESSED:
    a few random items that accidentally got left uncompressed but are actually compressed


Goals:
Face:
    only etc_norm and etc_mask if the face has a beard, otherwise waste of space.
    Beard faces:
        Just consider all male faces tbh.

beard mask:
r = data
g = can sometimes hold significant data, better use the same upscale as R
b = very little data use a pixel scaler (mask)
a = data

beard norm:
r = data x 
g = data y
b = sometimes blank sometimes data use pixel scaler
a = alpha

Hair:
    BC7: hir_mask, hir_norm
    BC1: hir_mask, hir_norm, hir_spec, hir_base
Hair Accessory: try just upscaling the norm

hair normal:

a = alpha

hair mask:

R&G could be considered correlated as contamination would be insignificant
