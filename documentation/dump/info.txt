For BC1 of same size in 6_3 and 7_0:
1. convert to png (Because of all BC1_UNORM w/ 1.bit being converted to BC7 we can assume no transparency for these images)
2. similarity check
3. if similarity check > 98% we have identical textures.
4. if not we have new textures.

For not the same size in 6_3 and 7_0:
1. we assume some substantial difference.
2. if resolution differs we assume new.
3. if resolution doesn't differ but compression does we assume inspection.
4. We should inspect conversions from BC1_UNORM /w 1.bit alpha to BC7
5. We should inspect conversions from BC3_UNORM to BC7.

If we found identical textures what do we do?
1. copy the textures from the upscaled textures pack as they can just be reimplemented directly.

If we found not-identical textures but of the same resolution as previously:
If they are BC1, process them in the normal format. an example can be found in "w_aet_001_kin_n" we see the same resolution but a modification.
If we see BC1_UNORM to BC7 or BC3_UNORM to BC7 of same size, we CAN perform a similarity check, but we could also just jump to upscaling.

research on bg types:
bg consists of: _d diffuse, _n normal, and _s specular.
further can be categorized as has alpha or does not. usually only diffuse has alpha.
Almost all specular are changed. I do not modify specular so that is ignored.
Almost all diffuse of not alpha type are substantially identical. However do to recompressing, they present a small difference which must be detected by similarity checks exceeding 98%.
Almost all normal are substantially identical simliar to diffuse. However, certain normals have had data added to their B channel. because of this we perform the similarity check.

research on bg common types:
ignore _s suffix
hou\ housing items
    These can be tricky. It seems normal and diffuse should be safe, if type=bc1
miji\ ??
nature\ particle effects (probably safe to ignore)
texture\ useless dummies
world\ world textures that are common to all game zones.
    Upscale normal and diffuse if type=bc1
For all common types make sure we are not retreading ground. Make sure we are not upscaling assets that have been increased in resolution.


chara/human:
we have files of BC1, BC2, BC3, BC5, BC7.
For BC7 we have base, norm, mask:
Given the quality of the BC7, I only see the need to address hair and etc. They will be upgraded to 2x with varying methods:
mask: 4x_fatality_faces on each channel + area box 50% resizing. channel B will be handled with XBR
normal: 4x_fatality_faces on each channel + area box 50% resizing.
