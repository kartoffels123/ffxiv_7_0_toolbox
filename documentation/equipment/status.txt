@FFXIV 
equipment is more or less done
we are clocking in at 
**31.84 GB** before deduping
Dedupe of main mass is  ~ **26.8 GB**

Previously:
 x2 equipment (up to 6.3) was 
**36.7 GB **before deduping
and 
x4 equipment (up to 6.3) was 
over **118GB **before deduping.

Going forward I want to maintain one format.

ID[ type = BC5; scale = x2; upscaling = XBR_x2NoBlend+XBR_x2Blend for G, XBR_x2NoBlend for R]
D[ type = BC7, BC1; scale = x2; cleaning = bc1smooth2; upscaling = lollypop; downscaling = box]

N[ type= BC7; scale = x1, x2; cleaning = bc1smooth2; upscaling = scalenx/lollypop for RG, scalenx for B; downscaling = box]

mass: 
ID = 19.5GB @ BC5 x2
Diffuse = 2.86 GB @ BC7 x1
Multi = 3.29 GB @ BC7 x2
Specular = 0.73 GB @ BC7 x2
Normal = 5.46 GB @ BC7 x1

possible downgrade (without reducing quality tbh)
Multi = 1.65 GB @ BC1 x2 (might actually be mandatory)
Specular  = 0.18 GB @ BC7 x1

Downgrade would reduce mass to **29.65 GB** 

Why only 1 version?
Easier to maintain and not as much upgrade needed with new graphics.
