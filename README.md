Contains some documentation, scripts.

Of particular interest are:

- documentation: diagrams
- scripts: the ffxiv_id_upscaler_gui.py which upscales ID textures.
- scripts: penumbra_mods_deobfuscator.py which creates a copy of a penumbra mod directory with intelligible paths (very useful for heliosphere or textool mods).
- documentation and scripts: viera hats for a list of all hats as of 24/08/23 (YY/MM/DD) in penumbra EQP format. There are also scripts to modify penumbra EQP.
- documentation and scripts: sha checks for updating future content.

These are all things I used to help
1. find which textures to ignore
2. migrate textures which could be migrated
3. create new textures
4. dispose or update textures as square enix continues through dawntrail.
